ExRelease Export
================
A Python macro for AvsPmod that is designed to be used with AVS scripts generated by [ExRelease](https://github.com/line0/ExRelease) for quick and easy exporting of bookmarked frames. It is intended to be used by users of the [Screenshot Comparison tutorial](http://forums.bakabt.me/index.php?topic=38998.0) written by line0. The macro will not work with any other AVS scripts without heavy adjustment due to reliance on specific variables that are present in the ExRelease-generated scripts.

Requirements
------------
ExRelease Export requires the following:

* [Python](http://www.python.org/)
* [AvsPmod](https://github.com/AvsPmod/AvsPmod)

The script generated by ExRelease has further prerequisites that are detailed in the tutorial that users are intended to be using (see link above).

Installation
------------
Download the raw Python file and put it in your AvsPmod macros directory (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\AvsPmod\macros).

Usage
-----
In AvsPmod, click *Macros* in the top bar and then *ExRelease Export*. The macro will automatically run and generate 8-bit PNGs of all the frames that are bookmarked. Once complete, a prompt is displayed indicating how many images were exported.

Credits
-------
This macro is based on the original [Save Image Sequence](https://github.com/AvsPmod/AvsPmod/blob/master/macros/Save%20Image%20Sequence.py) macro created by AvsPmod authors. Many thanks to them for creating such a convenient script.
